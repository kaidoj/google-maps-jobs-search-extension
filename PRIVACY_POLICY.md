*Last updated: April 21, 2025*

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the Hidden Job Search Helper Chrome extension ("we", "our", or "the Extension") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Extension. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected and being transparent about how we handle your data.

## Information Collection and Use

### Information We Collect

The Hidden Job Search Helper Extension collects and processes the following information:

1. **Search Parameters**: Keywords, locations, and other search criteria you enter in the Extension.
2. **Website Data**: Information gathered from public websites that are visited through Google Maps, including:
   - Business names and addresses displayed on Google Maps
   - Website URLs from Google Maps listings
   - Job-related content found on those websites
   - Contact information (email addresses) that is publicly available on those websites

3. **Local Storage Data**: The Extension saves your search preferences and cached results locally on your device using Chrome's storage API.

### How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information solely to:

- Provide the core functionality of the Extension (finding job opportunities from businesses on Google Maps)
- Improve your search experience by caching results to prevent redundant website visits
- Save your search preferences for convenience

## Data Storage

### Local Storage

All data collected by the Extension is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This includes:

- Your search preferences (keywords, locations, etc.)
- Cached search results

### Remote Storage

The Extension does not:
- Upload or transmit your data to any external servers
- Store your information in any cloud storage
- Share your data with third parties

## Third-Party Access

We do not share your data with any third parties. The Extension operates entirely within your browser and only accesses:

1. Google Maps pages (to find businesses)
2. Publicly accessible websites listed on Google Maps (to find job-related content)

## User Controls and Rights

You have complete control over the data stored by the Extension:

- You can clear the Extension's cached data through Chrome's extension management

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures within the Extension to protect your information:

- All data remains locally on your device
- The Extension follows security best practices for Chrome extension development
- We implement protections against common security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS)

## Cookies

The Extension itself does not set cookies. However, the websites you visit through the Extension may use their own cookies and tracking technologies according to their own privacy policies, which are outside our control.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Children's Privacy
